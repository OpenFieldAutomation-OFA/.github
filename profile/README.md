# Hi there
We use this github page to collect and share all information around the Open Field Automation (OFA) iniative. <br>
OFA aims to provide open source automation technology for off-highway farming applications. <br>
Currently we're working on: <br>
1) carrier vehicle for scouting and weeding (100 kg payload) <br>
2) weeding tool based on single pulse electric discharge <br>
3) interface between FMIS (Farm Management and Information System) and carrier vehicle <br>
4) interface between carrier vehicle and tool (implement) <br>
<br>
Our goal is to enable sustainable production processes by making field robots compliant with existing equipment and workflows <br>
<br>
For more information or further requests, please reach out to martin.bauer@bfh.ch  <br>

Talk to you soon!
